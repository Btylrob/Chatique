## 🎯 Objective

1. 🟢 Ideal project result
	1. An Telegram bot
2. 🟠 Acceptable result
	2. 
## ❓ Expectations
1. 🟢 Helpful to the project
	1. Fine-Tuning model with english.csv data, "data of most obscene language"
	2. Using facebook/roberta-model to detect hate speech 
2. 🟠 Roadblocks
	1.  Although facebook/roberta-hate-speech-model is an excellent way to detect hate speech it has a hard time detecting misspelled hate words and other offensive language that does not necessarily fall into hate speech label.
3. 👨‍💻 Insights
	1. During this project I learned about Pythons multithreading process which allows multiple threads execute at the same time within a single process. I thought this was very interesting as
           in Go which im more familiar with uses Go routines.
   	2. As this was my first python project another thing I learned was about the basic workings around Flask web application framework. I found the official Flask documentation very helpful 	  which I will link below.
## ✅ Tasks
[ ] Apply a image-recognition model to recognize nsfw images.
[ ] Implement a better file structure for Chatique and focus on readbility and upgradebility.
